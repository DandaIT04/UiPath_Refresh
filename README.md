# UiPath_Refresh
Trying to refresh usage of UiPath by attempting to redo my last assignment. Basically, i am to retrieve share prices of coca cola from MSN by scraping the data to xlsx file, create a chart based on date and open share price to be able to see share price increase over time and send the email to my teammates.
